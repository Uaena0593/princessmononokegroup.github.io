        <h4 class = 'wow'><span class = 'one'>Princess Mononoke</span> is an animated film by Studio Ghibli and originating from Japan. It explores essential themes such as the significance of <span class = 'three'>nature</span>, <span class = 'three'>environmental preservation</span>, and the <span class = 'three'>impact of urbanization on wildlife</span>. It draws inspiration from <span class = 'three'>Japanese Culture</span>, seen in various Japanese spirits making an appearance throughout the film. 
            <br><br>Simultaneously, Princess Mononoke exists as a <span class = 'three'>text</span>, <span class = 'three'>technology</span> and <span class = 'three'>physical and intangible commodity</span>. It is seen as a text through its presentation of binary opposition, blended sets of codes and denotation. As technology, it demonstrates ideas of technological determinism and active audience theory. As a commodity, Studio Ghibli (the animation studio), sells itself as a physical commodity in two separate forms. One is selling copies of the movie, both tangible and intangible, and the other is a Studio Ghibli Theme Park for fans of the studio.

        <br>A text can be defined as “any set of signs read for meaning” and “constructed and interpreted with reference to codes and conventions” (Chandler & Munday 2020)
        <br><br><span class = 'three'>Relation to the Movie (Blended Set of Codes):</span><br>
        <span class="tab">Princess Mononoke demonstrates a blended set of <span class = 'four'>codes, conventions</span> and <span class = 'four'>binary thinking</span>. Both of which can be defined as a text, as we will deconstruct and interpret these sets of signs and deduce meaning. 
        The codes and conventions in Princess Mononoke can include how it was produced and written in Japan but it looks at global issues and messages that pertain to the global spectrum. Princess Mononoke examines cultural and environmental codes. We see Japanese culture and history through the representation of the Muromachi era, Japanese mythology and the typical ‘anime’ art style. Additionally, Princess Mononoke is a signature work of <span class="four">Hayao Miyazaki's style</span>, therefore pulling on Miyazaki codes. He employs a strong female heroine (San) and includes fantasy elements that are a commentary on real-world problems.</span>

            <span class = 'three'>Binary Opposition (Lady Eboshi):</span><br>
            <span class="tab">Lady Eboshi (<em>seen on left</em>) is the leader of Irontown and the main antagonist in Princess Mononoke. Despite her black-and-white role of “the antagonist”, as a human, she is a hero because she views people equally. For example, she freed lepers and women that previously worked in brothels and gave them a place to work and live. As a human, she represents the goodness of the human psyche. However, as the villain of the story, she treats the environment poorly. Her plan to industrialize and expand the town has adverse effects on nature. Overall, Lady Eboshi represents the good and bad of humans, hence how she demonstrates binary thinking.</span>
            <br><br><span class="three">Binary Opposition (San):</span><br>
            <span class="tab">San is a human raised by wolves. Biologically, she is a human but she lives and communicates as a wolf would. The entire film portrays the struggle between nature and humans, while San exists in the middle. San represents nature, along with the animal gods and spirits. Compared to human beings like Lady Eboshi and Irontown, both sides are representative of the destruction that both parties inflict on each other.</span>

            <span class="three">Binary Opposition (Ashitaka):</span><br>
            <span class="tab">Ashitaka (<em>seen on right</em>) is someone who also embodies binary thinning (a human who falls in love with San and nature). He is a symbol of peace in the film but no matter how much he tries to make reconciliations between man and nature, he is still unable to change the tragic ending. While he symbolizes peace, he brings destruction to nature because he is a human. Only through teaming up with San is he able to turn their dire situation around. This suggests that both of them can only survive if they live harmoniously (humans with nature).</span>
        <br><br>
        <span class = 'tab'>The Princess Mononoke is a text that represents the destructive yet symbiotic relationship between humans and nature. Each character represents different elements of opposition. San herself is neither a human nor a wolf, while Ashitaka is a human who wants to protect nature. However, Ashitaka’s race only seems to destroy the exact thing he actively tries to protect. And while Lady Eboshi is a strong woman who has performed humanitarian acts, simultaneously, she destroys the environment.</span>

            <span class = 'three'>Technological Determinism:</span><br>
            <span class="tab">In this context, Princess Mononoke is an example of technology because it is a digitally produced animated film. In a literal sense, Princess Mononoke employs technology simply because it is a film. Visuals were both hand drawn and generated with computer animation. Aside from that, the film uses character modeling, scene graphics and action design to create a beautiful film that is up to par with today’s standards, despite its age.</span>
            <br><br><span class = 'tab'>Apart from its literal sense, Princess Mononoke exists as a technology because of technological determinism. Technological determinism is the “idea that technology has an important impact on our lives” (Chandler & Monday 2020). This is a stance that implies that the technology we consume has an impact on society. Undeniably, Princess Mononoke acts as a critique on how humans are torn between development versus preservation, a common theme in the film. At this point, do we continue to develop our technology at the expense of its impact on us or do we preserve what we have, and be complacent with our current progress? This can be related back to Lady Eboshi and San.</span>

        <span class="three">Determinism (Production of the Film):
        <br>
        </span><span class = 'tab'>The film's character modeling, scene graphics, and action design to the present are very natural and beautiful, special effects are also very colorful, from the painting for the audience to create an "immersive" visual experience, which is one of the key reasons to harvest many fans. Aurally, there is no shortage of emotionally charged sequences in films, and the production of sound is crucial when the picture needs to be rendered the most. Sound can shape the image and portray the character's personality, the character's voice can make the character more distinct, and the background music can better create the picture and set the atmosphere in the climax part or lyrical part, enhancing the artistry and infectiousness of the film picture, loved by the audience. So the film can also be called a comprehensive technology, the film as technology also decided that Princess Mononoke will have a large market.

            <span class="tab">A commodity can be defined as “any product that can be bought or sold” (Oxford). While Princess Mononoke is a film, it can still be bought and sold both intangibly (the movie) and tangibly (physical copies of the film). It was originally sold in physical copies when it was first theatrically released in Japan’s box office. It was later released in the USA and also on VHS, home video and TV in Japan.</span>

        <h4 class = 'wow'><span class="tab">Another example of Princess Mononoke being sold as a commodity is through the Studio Ghibli Theme Park. This is because Hayao Miyazaki is recognized as the master of animation, and his works are timeless classics that can be enjoyed by all age groups. Studio Ghibli saw its potential and the film established a strong brand image and has clear market influence over the industry. </span>
            <br><br>
            <span class="tab">Due to this, they made a theme park to showcase different aspects of the various movies they’ve produced. The selling point of the theme park is the fact that it resonates with the fans. The visual attractions include large human sized recreations of scenes from the iconic movies. Aside from the theme park, Studio Ghibli is sold as a commodity through themed food, toys, stuffed animals and much more. </span>
